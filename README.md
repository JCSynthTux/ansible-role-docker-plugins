# Ansible Role: manage_docker_plugins

This Ansible role manages Docker plugins by installing and configuring them with optional plugin options. The user can provide multiple plugins in a list.

## Requirements

- Ansible 2.9+
- Docker installed on the target system
- `community.docker` collection

## Role Variables

The role has a single variable, `docker_plugins`, which is a list of plugins to be managed. Each plugin can have optional options.

### Example of `docker_plugins` Variable

```yaml
docker_plugins:
  - name: "weaveworks/net-plugin:latest_release"
    options:
      IPALLOC_RANGE: "10.32.0.0/12"
      WEAVE_PASSWORD: "PASSWORD"
  - name: "another/plugin:version"
    options:
      SOME_OPTION: "value"
  - name: "simple/plugin:latest"
    options: {}
```

- `name`: The name of the Docker plugin to be installed.
- `options`: A dictionary of options to configure the plugin. This field is optional and defaults to an empty dictionary if not provided.

## Dependencies
